## Active Java Kernels

- [Rapaio](https://github.com/padreati/rapaio-jupyter-kernel/) - release in 2023 Rapaio Jupyter kernel works with Java 21.
- [Kotlin](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-jupyter) - The kernel is a powerful engine designed to enhance your Kotlin REPL experience. It offers support for executing code cells, providing basic code completion, and analyzing errors
- [Ganymede](https://github.com/allen-ball/ganymede) - a Jupyter Notebook Java kernel based on the Java Shell tool, JShell.
- [JJava](https://github.com/dflib/jjava) - a kernel for Java. Started as a fork of iJava, but is fully supported and constantly adding new features.
- [Almond](https://almond.sh/) - A kernel for Scala.
- [Toree](https://toree.apache.org/) - A kernel for Spark written in Scala.

## Inactive Java Kernels

- [IJava](https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava) - the "original" Java kernel. Not actively maintained.
- [SciJava Kernel](https://github.com/scijava/scijava-jupyter-kernel) - Defunct kernel based on BeakerX.
- [java9_kernel](https://github.com/Bachmann1234/java9_kernel) - defunct Java 9 based kernel. On this list as has interesting approach on wrapping/calling from python.
- [BeakerX](https://github.com/twosigma/beakerx) - BeakerX is a collection of polyglot JVM kernels and interactive widgets for plotting, tables, autotranslation, and other extensions to Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Lab version 1.2.x and 2.x. Seems somewhat defunct.
- [JSR223 Kernel](https://github.com/fiber-space/jupyter-kernel-jsr223) - A JSR223 compliant Jupyter kernel implementation in Java.

## Java Related Kernels

- [Polyglot Notebook VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode) - Supports various lanuages from .net family, but has a Java feature request https://github.com/dotnet/interactive/issues/3084

## Online Jupyter Notebook Java capable environments

- [mybinder](https://mybinder.org/)
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- [Red Hat OpenShift Sandbox](https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox) with Red Hat DataScience
- [GitPod](https://gitpod.io)
- [GitHub CodeSpaces](https://github.com/codespaces)
- [OpenShift Workspaces](https://workspaces.openshift.com/)

## Jupyter Auxiliary Libraries

- [jupyter/jvm-repr](https://github.com/jupyter/jvm-repr) - API for converting JVM objects to representations by MIME type, for the Jupyter ecosystem. 
- [jupyter/jvm-magics](https://github.com/jupyter/jvm-magics) - A plugin system for magic function implementations across JVM kernels.
- [spencerpar/jupyter-jvm-basekernel](https://github.com/SpencerPark/jupyter-jvm-basekernel) - Base kernel to use for base implementation of a Jupyter Kernel

## Not Jupyter but similar for Java

- [jnotebook](https://jnotebook.catheu.tech/) - a modern notebook system for Java. `jnotebook` interprets Java JShell files and render them as notebooks.
- [Apache Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.apache.org/) - Web-based notebook that enables data-driven,
interactive data analytics and collaborative documents with SQL, Scala, Python, R, Java and more.
